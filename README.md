## Project Background

The AM43 blind motor has a terrible mobile app and it would be nice to control these devices using simple api calls to a RPI with BLE to tie into a home automation platform.

Install using:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

Needing to add more endpoints

Run using:
`flask run --host=0.0.0.0`
